# LetterBolt Renderer

ðŸš§ - WIP - ðŸš§

Notion renderer optimized for newsletters that runs on edge.

This is the core of an upcoming product by DevClad called LetterBolt, a premium newsletter experience for Notion.

## Why (by) DevClad?

I plan on making this a day-0 revenue product and push it at the forefront of the "workspace" platform of DevClad. This way I can dogfood DevClad's workspace and team capabilites with a real-world product.
